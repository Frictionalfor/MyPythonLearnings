#This is 7-12-2025 revising whole Python again!!

print("Hello, World!") #print() is used to print output to the console

x = 5 # Assigning the integer value 5 to variable x
print(x) # Printing the value of x
print("x = ", x) # Printing a string along with the value of x

name = "Alice" # Assigning the string "Alice" to variable name
print("Hello, " + name + "!") # Concatenating strings and printing a greeting

# Demonstrating basic arithmetic operations
a = 10
b = 3
print("a =", a)
print("b =", b)
print(a+b) # Addition
print(a-b) # Subtraction
print(a*b) # Multiplication
print(a/b) # Division
print(a//b) # Floor Division
print(a%b) # Modulus
print(a**b) # Exponentiation
print() # Printing a blank line for better readability

# Demonstrating variable reassignment
x = 20
print("New value of x =", x)
y = x + 15
print("Value of y =", y)
print() # Printing a blank line for better readability

# Demonstrating string manipulation
greeting = "Hello"
greeting += ", World!" # Using += operator to concatenate strings
print(greeting)
print() # Printing a blank line for better readability

# Demonstrating multiple variable assignments
m, n, p = 1, 2, 3
print("m =", m)
print("n =", n)
print("p =", p)
